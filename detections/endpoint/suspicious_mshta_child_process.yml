description: The following analytic identifies child processes spawning from  "mshta.exe".
  The search will return the first time and last time these command-line arguments
  were used for these executions, as well as the target system, the user, parent process
  "mshta.exe" and its child process.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.

  this behavior, triggering a false positive.
