description: The following analytic identifies a renamed instance of microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe.
  Microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319
  and is rarely utilized. When investigating, identify the executed code on disk and
  review. A spawned child process from microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe is uncommon.
  In any instance, microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe spawning from an Office product
  or any living off the land binary is highly suspect.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.

  copy of microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe, triggering a false positive.
